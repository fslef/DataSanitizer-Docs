# Welcome to DataSanitizer documentation

DataSanitizer is a PowerShell module designed to detect and remove sensitive information from files and data sources. It helps you anonymize, clean, or validate data to protect privacy, comply with regulations, and safely share information.

ðŸš§ "Under (Enthusiastic) Construction" ðŸš§

This documentation is still stretching, hydrating, and figuring out its final form. Some sections are missing, others are placeholders pretending to be real content, and a few are still on my TODO list sipping coffee.

Need something that isnâ€™t here yet?
â€¢ Ask for it: open an issue or start a discussion.
â€¢ Suggest it: feature requests are very welcome.
â€¢ Help build it: PRs = instant karma.
