# Getting Started with DataSanitizer

DataSanitizer is a PowerShell module that identifies and anonymizes sensitive data in log files using configurable detection rules.

To get started, complete these steps in order:

1. [Install the PowerShell Module](./2-install-online) - Install DataSanitizer from PowerShell Gallery or offline files
2. [Initialize Your Working Folder](./4-new-working%20folder) - Create a structured directory for configuration, rules, and data files
3. [Configure DataSanitizer](./5-update-config-file) - Set up paths and preferences, then load the configuration

After setup, you can place data files in your working folder and run DataSanitizer analysis commands.
